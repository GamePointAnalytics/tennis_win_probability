# tennis_win_probability
The C# program TennisWinningProbabilities.cs calculates a player's game and set winning probabilities for different game and point score combinations, based on the player's service and return point winning probability.
This method is commonly used to predict the game and set winner in online sports betting.
The win probability data generated from this model will be compared with the empirical win probability data calculated from the pro tennis match data. The goal is to check if the model makes accurate prediction.
